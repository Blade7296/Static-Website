# Website for our blog
This is just a simple sample Website I create to practice my web developing skill.

## Introduction
Hello. I just started learning Web-Development course not long ago and would love to put the knowledge i gained from the course into practice.

## What is this?
My hobby is to cook and play games. My girlfriend likes to create content through Youtube and I help her edit the video. So, for my first project i'm creating a simple blog containing our introduction, videos from our youtube channel and how to connect with us.

## What is my goal?
I'm aiming to be a front end web developer and someday to be a full stack web developer. This is my beginning.
