# Static Website for Food Blog
This is just a sample static website

## Introduction
Hi.. I just recently started learning Web-Development course and would love to put the knowledge i gained from the course into practice..

## What is this project all about?
My hobby is to cook and share it with my friends.. Therefore, for my first project i'm creating a simple food blog website containing the foods that i've cooked so far and the recipe on how to make it..

## What is my goal?
I'm aiming to be a front end web developer and someday to be a full stack web developer. This is my beginning.
