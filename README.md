# Static Website for Food Blog
This is just a sample static website

## Introduction
Hi.. I just recently started learning Web-Development course and would love to put the knowledge i gained from the course into practice..

## What is this project all about?
My hobby is to cook and share it with my friends.. My girlfriend likes to create content through Youtube and i help her edit the video. Therefore, for my first project i'm creating a simple blog containing the foods that i've cooked so far and the recipe on how to make it, videos from our youtube channel and some traveling vlog..

## What is my goal?
I'm aiming to be a front end web developer and someday to be a full stack web developer. This is my beginning.
